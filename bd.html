  As the lowest mass products of star formation, brown dwarfs form a bridge between stars and giant planets. 
  Given their similar age and temperature as giant planets, brown dwarfs offer an incredible opportunity to indirectly 
  study giant planet physical and atmospheric properties in significantly more observationally favorable conditions.

  I leveraged recent advances in high-precision parallax measurements to derive the 
  bolometric luminosities of 1000+ ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6 and later) by directly integrating 
  flux-calibrated optical to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) constructed entirely using 
  <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15802304"><em>The UltracoolSheet</em></a>. My SEDs consist of low resolution near-infrared NASA/IRTF SpeX Prism spectra, 
  optical photometry from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and mid-infrared photometry from the WISE survey and/or 
  Spitzer/IRAC. Coupling the derived bolometric luminosities and uniformly analyzed age estimates of these 
  objects with evolutionary models, I estimated the masses, radii, and effective temperatures of substellar 
  objects across the M, L, and T spectral sequence. This work increased the sample size of ultracool dwarfs 
  with semi-empirical fundamental physical parameters by a factor of ~5. Additionally, I constructed and analyzed 
  relationships between luminosity and temperature as functions of spectral type and investigate atmospheric 
  model systematics. The calculated fundamental parameters will serve as a critical resource for future studies 
  on stellar/substellar mass function, brown dwarf evolutionary models, and exoplanet characterization. The fundamental parameter estimates 
  are publicly available <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10086810">here</a>.

  Beyond this work, my techniques have proved useful in the wider context of the field. I used my SED analysis pipeline to calculate the 
  integrated-light luminosity of the brown dwarf binary VHS 1256-1257 AB, which in turn has led to precise constraints on the mass of its 
  planetary-mass companion VHS 1256-1257 b, the first substellar companion for which JWST has 
  delivered a complete infrared spectrum. My luminosity and mass measurement for brown dwarf
  binary WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 combined with the detection of polarized radio pulsations by the lead authors of the study led to important
  constraints on the magnetic fields of the component brown dwarfs. Finally, I synthesized JWST/NIRCam, Euclid, and Roman photometry for 800+ ultracool dwarfs to 
  construct absolute magnitude-spectral type relations. My relations enable the calculation of photometric distances for ultracool dwarfs 
  observed with JWST in the absence of parallax measurements. Additionally, using the synthesized photometry to generate color-color
  figures can help distinguish high-redshift galaxies from brown dwarf interlopers.
