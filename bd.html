  As the lowest mass products of star formation, brown dwarfs form a bridge between stars and giant planets. 
  Given their similar age and temperature as giant planets, brown dwarfs offer an incredible opportunity to indirectly 
  study giant planet physical and atmospheric properties in significantly more observationally favorable conditions.

  I leveraged recent advances in high-precision parallax measurements to derive the 
  bolometric luminosities of 1000+ ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6 and later) by directly integrating 
  flux-calibrated optical to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) constructed entirely using 
  <a href="10.5281/zenodo.4169084"><em>The UltracoolSheet</em></a>. My SEDs consist of low resolution near-infrared NASA/IRTF SpeX Prism spectra, 
  optical photometry from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and mid-infrared photometry from the WISE survey and/or 
  Spitzer/IRAC. Coupling the derived bolometric luminosities and uniformly analyzed age estimates of these 
  objects with evolutionary models, I estimated the masses, radii, and effective temperatures of substellar 
  objects across the M, L, and T spectral sequence. This work increased the sample size of ultracool dwarfs 
  with semi-empirical fundamental physical parameters by a factor of ~5. Additionally, I constructed and analyzed 
  relationships between luminosity and temperature as functions of spectral type and investigate atmospheric 
  model systematics. The calculated fundamental parameters will serve as a critical resource for future studies 
  on stellar/substellar mass function, brown dwarf evolutionary models, and exoplanet characterization. The fundamental parameter estimates 
  are publicly available <a href="10.5281/zenodo.8315642">here</a>.
