In my second semester at UT Austin, I joined the White Dwarf Group as part of the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). FRI is a pioneering two-semester program that enables first-year undergraduates to participate in real-world research projects. Drs. Michael Montgomery and Zachary Vanderbosch, the PIs of the White Dwarf Group, were collecting near-nightly images of a patch of sky over a period of ∼1.5 years to investigate a white dwarf showing signs of transiting planetary debris. However, these observations simultaneously captured nearly 2000 stars in the telescope’s field of view, none of which were being studied as part of the program.

There was a unique opportunity to leverage the exquisite high-cadence dataset of 1560 images and conduct a deep search for short- and long-term variability in these “background” stars. I performed aperture photometry on 2000+ stars and assembled their light curves. Using the light curves, I generated Lomb-Scargle periodograms and developed an automated procedure to search for high-significance periodicities. I discovered and characterized 27 previously unknown variable stars and eclipsing binaries, a factor of ∼2.5 increase in the number known from previous generations of surveys of the same patch of sky.
