As a LEAP Mentor, I build meaningful relationships with my peers by aiding them in formulating their personal definition of leadership and 
translating their personal goals into a Leadership Action Plan to guide their college experience. I facilitate the creation of a brave space 
among participants to empower students to acknowledge differences and recognize them as an opportunity to achieve greater understanding and progress.

As the Tutor Coordinator for the College Readiness Program in the College of Natural Sciences (CNS), I managed a dedicated team of three tutors 
and guided them through the process of remote tutoring  incoming CNS freshmen in their preparation for the UT Math Assessment. I shared key strategies on managing 
time, securing research opportunities, and getting involved in outreach, with students on succeeding in the Longhorn community and served as 
their go-to support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I work as a trained tutor at the Sanger Learning Center at the University of Texas at Austin helping students, one-on-one, understand concepts, 
principles underlying questions, and problems covered in introductory physics, astronomy, and calculus courses. As a student educator, 
I contribute to the University’s core purpose and mission by fostering independent learning using active learning techniques rooted in education research.

As an active outreach volunteer at ASA, I communicated my research on brown dwarfs to students at Kealing Middle School and set-up a telescope 
viewing of Jupiter and Saturn at the Bullock Texas State History Museum. At UT Austin, I explained concepts in astronomy (e.g., the mechanism of supernovae 
explosions, crater geography on Mars, the doppler effect) to elementary school students attending “Hot Science – Cool Talks” organized by the Environmental Science 
Institute and participated in astronomy outreach on UT Girl Day.
