<h2>Leadership Education and Progress (LEAP) Program Mentor, Leadership and Ethics Institute (LEI), UT Austin </h2>
As a LEAP Mentor, I build meaningful relationships with my peers by aiding them in formulating their personal definition of leadership and 
translating their personal goals into a Leadership Action Plan to guide their college experience. I facilitate the creation of a brave space 
among participants to empower students to acknowledge differences and recognize them as an opportunity to achieve greater understanding and progress.

<h2>Student Educator and Tutor, Sanger Learning Center, UT Austin </h2>
I work as a trained tutor at the Sanger Learning Center at the University of Texas at Austin helping students, one-on-one, understand concepts, 
principles underlying questions, and problems covered in introductory physics, astronomy, and calculus courses. As a student educator, 
I contribute to the University’s core purpose and mission by fostering independent learning using active learning techniques rooted in education research.

<h2>College Readiness Mentor, College of Natural Sciences, UT Austin </h2>
As the Tutor Coordinator for the College Readiness Program in the College of Natural Sciences (CNS), I managed a dedicated team of three tutors 
and guided them through the process of remote tutoring  incoming CNS freshmen in their preparation for the UT Math Assessment. I shared key strategies on managing 
time, securing research opportunities, and getting involved in outreach, with students on succeeding in the Longhorn community and served as 
their go-to support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<h2>Astronomy Student's Association, UT Austin</h2>
As an active outreach volunteer at ASA, I communicated my research on brown dwarfs to students at Kealing Middle School and set-up a telescope 
viewing of Jupiter and Saturn at the Bullock Texas State History Museum. At UT Austin, I explained concepts in astronomy (e.g., the mechanism of supernovae 
explosions, crater geography on Mars, the doppler effect) to elementary school students attending “Hot Science – Cool Talks” organized by the Environmental Science 
Institute and participated in astronomy outreach on UT Girl Day.
