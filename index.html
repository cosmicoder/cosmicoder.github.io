<center><b><h1> Welcome! </h1></b></center>

<p>
My name is Aniket Sanghi (he/him/his) and I am an astronomer-in-training and sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin.
Self-driven, productive, and a meticulous planner, I am driven by my passion for Physics, Astronomy, Technology,
and Scientific Communication. I seek to earn a Ph.D. in Astronomy and aim to to lead the scientific priorities of the next generation of 
telescopes by designing, proposing, and conducting large-scale, high-impact research programs and surveys, to push the boundaries of science that the astronomical community 
can accomplish. I strongly value creativity, building meaningful connections, and the role of inclusive mentorship in personal growth.  
</p>

<p>
I am actively involved in the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin through my participation in three research projects.
First, I am working with <a href="https://yifanzhou.space/"><b>Dr. Yifan Zhou</b></a> and <a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/~bpbowler/"><b>Dr. Brendan Bowler</b></a> 
on reference star differential imaging of the PDS70 planetary system using HST/WFC3 images.
Second, I am working with <b>Dr. William M.J. Best</b> on constraining the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.
Third, I am working with <a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/~mikemon/"><b>Dr. Michael H. Montgomery</b></a> and <a href="http://zvanderbosch.com/">
<b>Zachary Vanderbosch</b></a> to identify and analyze variable stars and eclipsing systems in
archival LCO photometric data. These projects are helping me develop a broad understanding of different sub-fields in astronomy 
to be able to apply a multidisciplinary approach towards defining the scientific goals of my future research programs.
