<strong><h2>Are we alone in the Universe? How do planets that harbor life form? Can we image and characterize an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star?</h2></strong>
<p>
These are the fundamental questions that Aniket Sanghi ultimately seeks to answer in his research career as an astronomer. 
The direct detection of radiation originating in exoplanetary atmospheres is a requirement for the identification of spectral signatures indicative of extraterrestrial biological activity. During his PhD, Sanghi aims to use the latest generation of ground- and space-based instrumentation to lead innovative projects that push the envelope in imaging and characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanetary systems.
As an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Astronomy and Physics at The University of Texas at Austin, Sanghi has conducted original research spanning the mass ladder of astronomical objects – stars, brown dwarfs, and planets – to tackle the above questions from an interdisciplinary perspective. Most notably, he has made significant contributions to our observational understanding of giant planet formation by developing novel exoplanet imaging techniques with the Hubble Space Telescope and using them to characterize new actively forming exoplanets embedded in the disks of their parent stars. Further, as a SURF Fellow at the California Institute of Technology, Sanghi pushed the planet-detection sensitivity limits of the Keck Telescope to investigate the demographics of giant planets around low-mass stars. He has been recognized for his research efforts through numerous awards such as the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, the Universities Space Research Association’s Distinguished Undergraduate Award, and the American Astronomical Society’s Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award. 
Born in Fremont, California, Sanghi moved to India when he was 4 and spent most of his childhood in the city of Bangalore. When not working on research, he can be found playing his guitar, watching Formula 1, reading crime-thriller novels, gaming, and exploring the art of Japanese anime and manga.
