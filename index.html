<strong><h2>These are the fundamental questions that I ultimately seek to answer in my research career as an astronomer. </h2></strong>
<p>
The direct detection of radiation originating in exoplanetary atmospheres is a requirement for the identification of spectral signatures 
indicative of extraterrestrial biological activity. I aim to use the latest generation of ground- and space-based instrumentation to lead 
innovative projects that push the envelope in imaging and characterizing exoplanetary systems.
</p>
<p>
As an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Astronomy and Physics at The University of Texas at Austin, I conducted original research 
spanning the mass ladder of astronomical objects – stars, brown dwarfs, and planets – to tackle the above questions from an interdisciplinary 
perspective. Most notably, I made significant contributions to our observational understanding of giant planet formation by developing novel 
exoplanet imaging techniques with the Hubble Space Telescope and using them to characterize new actively forming exoplanets embedded in the disks 
of their parent stars. Further, as a SURF Fellow at the California Institute of Technology, I pushed the planet-detection sensitivity limits 
of the Keck Telescope to investigate the demographics of giant planets around low-mass stars. I have been recognized for my research efforts 
through numerous awards such as the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, the Universities Space Research Association’s Distinguished Undergraduate Award, 
and the American Astronomical Society’s Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award.

Born in Fremont, California, I moved to India when I was 4 and spent most of my childhood in the city of Bangalore. When not working on research, 
I can be found playing my guitar, watching Formula 1, reading crime-thriller novels, gaming, and exploring the art of Japanese anime and manga.
