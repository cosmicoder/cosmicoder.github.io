My name is Aniket Sanghi (he/him/his) and I am an astronomer-in-training and junior at the University of Texas at Austin.
Self-driven, productive, and a meticulous planner, I am driven by my passion for Physics, Astronomy, Technology,
and Scientific Communication. I seek to earn a Ph.D. in Astronomy and aim to to lead the scientific priorities of the next generation of 
telescopes by designing, proposing, and conducting large-scale, high-impact research programs and surveys, to push the boundaries of science that the astronomical community 
can accomplish. I strongly value creativity, building meaningful connections, and the role of inclusive mentorship in personal growth.

As an undergraduate student, I am developing a broad understanding of different sub-fields in astronomy 
to be able to apply a multidisciplinary approach towards defining the scientific goals of my future research programs. Presently, my research is focused on optimizing
a high-contrast exoplanet imaging technique called reference star differential imaging (RDI) with ground- and space-based telescopes. This technique will enable
improvements in exoplanet detection limits and offers exciting opportunities for the discovery and characterizatioon of long-period giant planets and accreting protoplanets.
My previous research works include identifying and analyzing variable stars and eclipsing systems in
long-term Las Cumbres Observatory photometric data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13548">first-author paper</a> published in AJ!) and constraining the 
initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (co-authored paper in preparation).
