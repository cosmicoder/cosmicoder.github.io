I am an early career astronomer and a senior undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. After graduation, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. in Astrophysics at Caltech as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. Creativity and building new and meaningful connections are the core ideas I value along with a passion for astronomy, physics, outreach, and scientific communication. My long-term goal is to become a professor or research scientist in astrophysics leading high-impact research programs and promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM through active K-12 outreach. 

I am collaborating with faculty members across institutions such as UT Austin, Caltech, and the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii-MƒÅnoa in my journey to uncover the unknown. My research spans the areas of exoplanet imaging and characterization, brown dwarfs, and variable stars with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck Telescope, and more. I extensively use mathematical and statistical methods of analysis in my work. You can learn more at https://cosmicoder.github.io/.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the guitar, watching Formula 1, gaming, and exploring the art of Japanese anime and manga. Feel free to reach out, I would love to connect!
