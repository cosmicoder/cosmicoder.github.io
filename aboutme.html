  I am a second year graduate student and NSF Research Fellow pursuing a Ph.D. in Astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology. I graduated summa 
  cum laude with a B.S. in Astronomy (Honors) and a B.S. in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in May 2023 and earned a M.S. in Astrophysics 
  from Caltech in June 2025. Advised by Prof. Dimitri Mawet, I work as a part of Caltech's <a href="https://etlab.caltech.edu">Exoplanet Technology 
  Laboratory (ET Lab)</a> to use novel ground- and space-based high-contrast imaging technologies for the direct detection and characterization of planets outside our Solar System. 
  The central motivation behind my research efforts is the question: <em>Are we alone in the Universe?</em> My long-term goal is to become a professor or 
  research scientist in Astrophysics leading high-impact research programs and training the next-generation of astronomers.

  My primary research interest lies in investigating the formation and evolution of <strong>Solar System-analog extrasolar gas giant planets</strong> using high-contrast imaging 
  and spectroscopy. The most typical giant exoplanets are located at separations between 1-10 au from their host stars. Traditionally, this populations has not been 
  accessible to direct characterization techniques either because their corresponding angular separations are too small for detection around young stars located 
  in moving groups (~10-100 pc) or the planets are too cold for near-infrared ground-based observations around mature field stars in our vicinity (within 10 pc).
  I am tackling both challenges in my work to <strong>bridge the exoplanet characterization gap</strong>.

  I am leveraging novel cross-aperture fiber nulling interferometric technologies, specifically 
  <a href=https://etlab.caltech.edu/research/developing-exoplanet-technologies/vfn>Vortex Fiber Nulling (VFN)</a> on the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer, to lead a
  multi-year spectroscopic campaign to search for substellar companions around Gaia-Hipparcos accelerating stars that have been vetted by deep 
  ground-based imaging for wide-separation companions. VFN is uniquely designed for companion detection within the inner working angle of traditional ground-based coronagraphic systems.

<center><h1>Undergraduate Research</h1></center>
<p> 
  As an undergraduate, I relentlessly pursued original research spanning the mass ladder of astronomical objects &#8212; 
  stars, brown dwarfs and planets &#8212; to tackle research questions at the forefront of the field from an interdisciplinary perspective. 
  My work led to the discovery and classification of variable stars, the development of novel planet-imaging techniques, the characterization of 
  forming exoplanets, and the calculation of fundamental properties for the largest sample (1000+) of ultracool dwarfs and planetary-mass companions. 
  I have been recognized for my research efforts through numerous awards such as the <strong>Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship</strong>, the  <strong>Universities Space Research 
  Association’s Distinguished Undergraduate Award</strong> and the <strong>American Astronomical Society’s Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award</strong>.

  Born in Fremont, California, I moved to India when I was 4 and spent most of my childhood in the Garden City of India, Bangalore. 
  Outside research, I enjoy playing the guitar and tennis, watching Formula 1, reading crime-thriller novels, gaming on my Playstation 5, and exploring the art 
  of Japanese anime.
