Young accreting planets are excellent testbeds for planet formation theories and early evolutionary models. By directly imaging accreting planets, we can constrain the speed at which planets grow, investigate planet-disk interactions, and characterize young planet atmospheres. I find this tremendous wealth of information in young planet observations exciting. However, newly formed planets (protoplanets) are at least a thousand times fainter than and only separated by a few resolution elements from their stars. To date, only two bona-fide protoplanets have been observed &#8212; PDS 70 b and c. <em>The scarcity of young planet discoveries has become one of the primary limitations to advancing our knowledge of planet formation.</em> Motivated by efforts to use H&alpha; emission (656 nm) from planetary accretion shock fronts as a tracer of active planet formation, I created a new technique to efficiently image young planets with Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). Further, I spearheaded the analysis of a first-of-its-kind HST survey of 10 transition disk-bearing stars in the H&alpha; wavelength to uncover a new candidate protoplanet &#8212 AB Aurigae b.
