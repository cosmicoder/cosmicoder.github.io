<h1> Reference Star Differential Imaging of the PDS 70 planetary system using the HST/WFC3 Archival PSF Library</h1>
<h3>Aniket Sanghi, Yifan Zhou, Brendan P. Bowler</h3>
The primary goal of my project in direct imaging of exoplanets is to develop a new image processing technique for detecting exoplanets in Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) observations. While the most commonly used technique of Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) is highly successful in ground-based 
observations of exoplanets, it is inherently difficult to schedule and perform with space-based telescopes such as HST, leading to low observing efficiency. 
I demonstrate the applicability of Reference Star Differential Imaging, a mechanically easier and relatively time inexpensive technique, to undersampled 
HST Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of PDS70 to uncover the planet PDS 70 b. My high-fidelity detection of this young planet enables detailed characterization 
of its formation processes. My technique will be directly applicable to the upcoming JWST observations to detect and characterize exoplanets and will also 
guide the direct observation strategies for future space-based missions. I am a co-investigator on a submitted JWST Cycle-1 proposal (PI - Yifan Zhou) to montitor
the PDS 70 planetary system.

<h1>Periodic Variable Stars and Eclipsing Systems in Archival LCO Photometric Data</h1>
<h3> Aniket Sanghi, Zachary Vanderbosch, Michael H. Montgomery </h3>

Pulsating variable stars are a fundamental part of the cosmic distance ladder that forms the foundation of cosmology. Eclipsing binary star systems 
enable the calculation of their orbits, the determination of companion masses, and also studying formation mechanisms, mass transfer, and accretion 
phenomena. My search for and discovery of periodic variable stars and systems further ties into the research goals of large-scale time-domain surveys 
such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO). We performed aperture photometry on about 900 archival LCO photometric images to identify variability in objects based on their 
light curves. For those which appeared variable, I identified the cause of their variability and determined whether follow-up observations are warranted. 
In total, I assessed for variability in about 2000 light curves to discover a total of 21, previously unknown, variable stars and eclipsing binary systems.

<h1>Measuring the Substellar IMF using a 25-pc Volume Limited Sample of L0-T8 Brown Dwarfs</h1>
<h3>William M.J. Best, Aniket Sanghi, Michael C. Liu, Eugene A. Magnier, Trent J. Dupuy</h3>

Brown dwarfs cool continuously through their lifetimes implying a degeneracy in spectral type and luminosity for different combinations of mass and age. 
This makes it difficult to utilize observables from photometry and spectroscopy to determine physical properties such as mass, age, metallicity etc., 
hindering our understanding of a brown dwarf’s evolutionary path. A statistical approach that can overcome this challenge is to model populations of 
brown dwarfs characterized by an initial mass function (IMF), a birth history, and an evolutionary model.
Our project measures the substellar IMF using a 25-pc volume limited sample of 369 L0-T8 brown dwarfs defined entirely by parallaxes.
We constrain the index alpha of the power-law IMF using the exponential age distribution, single-age distribution, and the Besançon Galaxy Model (BGM) of the 
solar neighborhood through a chi-square goodness-of-fit test utilizing the hybrid evolutionary models of Saumon & Marley (SM08) and the BT-Settl 
evolutionary models. We present the strongest substellar IMF constraints to date, finding a strong preference for a negative value of alpha, i.e., 
an average higher mass population of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. We obtain consistent values of alpha for SM08 and BT-Settl, 
indicating that the uncertainties on our constraints have not been underestimated. Our sample also agrees with previous results on a near uniform 
brown dwarf formation rate in the solar neighborhood but stands in contrast to the empirical Dupuy & Liu (2017) age distribution and the age distribution 
of the solar neighborhood presented by BGM.
